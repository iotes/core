## Getting Started


### Introduction to iotes

Modern front end libraries lean heavily on a declaritive approach to state management where interfaces which which react to updating state object or objects. This intergrates naturally well with REST or graphql services where new state is delivered on request, but requires some more thought for iot applications where the connection to a service is generally stateful, ie the connection remains open and the data is streamed in as and when it arrives. 

One solution is to allow front end component to subscribe to a stream of data from the iot device which remains open for the life time of the application. This 'device stream' only updates when new data is received, unaffected by the underlying connection status of the iot service allowing the front end component to listen to state updates and react in the usual way. 

However this means no connection information is provided on that stream. If a connection is never established because the remote iot service is unavaliable for example then no data will appear on the the device stream and the front end will appear unresponsive. 

In order to receive updates fromt the iot host (such as an mqtt broker), a host stream can be established in the same manner which is dedicted to connection status allowing components to react to connection status. Keeping the host stream seperate form the device stream allows different treatment of the connection state which can be convienient for analytics or debugging.

The iotes library provides an abstraction to create the host stream and the device stream for different connection strategies, and plugins for extra compatibility with different front end frameworks.

### General Design

iotes is deigned to a be a generic middleware to sit between a state management library (via a plugin) and iot api (via a strategy). It can operate without a plugin but must have a strategy in order to function.

Iotes works on an observable pattern, On initialization iotes creates two stores which handle `subscribers` (functions which are notified of store changes) and `dispatchers` (functions which update the store).

The two stores are the 

 - host store : for system events like connections, disconnections etc
 - device store: which is reserved one for data from the the iot devices. 

```

                ----------                      -----------                      -------------   
                |        |   -- dispatch -->    |         |   -- subscribe -->   |           |
    State <---> | Plugin |                      |  iotes  |                      | Strategy  |  <---> Network
                |        |   <-- subscribe --   |         |   <-- dispatch --    |           |
                ----------                      -----------                      -------------

```

### Installation

iotes is available as an [npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/iotes).

itoes strategies and plugins are avaliable as serperate npm packages, their names being with iotes-*

Install iotes locally via npm:

```bash
npm install iotes
```

To form a connection to an iot service you will need a connection strategy. This is to install a basic mqtt strategy.

```bash
npm install iotes-strategy-mqtt
```

~~A full list of strategies is avaliable [here](nolink)~~

There may also be an existing plugin avaliable for your front end framework, or you can write your own

```bash
npm install iotes-react-hooks
```

~~A full list of plugins is avaliable [here](nolink)~~

iotes is written in typescript and comes with full type declarations


### Using iotes

a new iotes instances is created by using the createIotes function, with your system topology declared,
more information can be found about system topolgy map can be found her here.

Each iotes instance may hande connection to multiple hosts, but only on strategy can be used per instance. 

iotes returns for functions for receiving and sending messages using the iotes host and device streams

```ts
    {
        hostSubscribe: (selector: (state) => state)
        hostDispatch: (hostDispatacble: HostDispatchable)
        deviceSubscribe: (selector: (state) => state)
        deviceDisptach: (hostDispatcable: HostDispatchable)
    }
```

The topology map is the main thing would need to supply. The topology map takes two arrays. An array of hosts and the devices

What a host is depends on the strategy, in the case of mqtt for example the host refers to the mqtt broker. In the case of the a phdiget it is a hub.

The devices are connected to the host by the hostName field in the device config. They will be connected to the correct host on iotes initialization.

```js
import { createIotes } from 'iotes'
import { createMqttStrategy } from 'iotes-mqtt-strategy'

const topologyMap= {
    hosts: [
        host: 'ws://127.0.0.1', 
        port: '1883', 
        name: 'mqttExample', 
        strategyConfig: {} 
    ],
    devices: [
        hostName: 'mqttExample',
        name 'deviceExample',
    ]
}

const { 
    hostSubscribe,
    hostDispatch,
    deviceSubscribe,
    deviceDisptach   
} = createItoes(topologyMap, createMqttStrategy)

hostSubscribe((state) => console.log(state))
```

        port: '1883', 
        name: 'mqttExample', 
        strategyConfig: {} 
    ],
    devices: [
        hostName: 'mqttExample',
        name 'deviceExample',

    ]
}

const { 
    hostSubscribe,
    hostDispatch,
    deviceSubscribe,
    deviceDisptach   
}: Iotes = createItoes(topologyMap, createMqttStrategy)


hostSubscribe((state: State) => console.log(state))

```
